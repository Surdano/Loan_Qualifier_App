## What it does

This is a python command-line-interface(CLI) that allows users to see qualifying loans from lenders quickly and easily. The application works by taking in a `daily_rate_sheet` of loan criteria from various loan providers, asking the user a number of questions to evaluate their loan eligibility, and then returning to them a list of qualifying loans. It also asks if the user wishes to save the returned list of qualifying loans.
